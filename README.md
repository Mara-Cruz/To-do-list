# TO DO LIST 

## The Challenge

- This exercise creates a to-do list where the user can add new tasks by entering text in the input field and clicking the "Agregar (Add)" button.
- Each task is added as a list item (`<li>`) with two buttons: one to mark the task as completed and another to remove it from the list.
- Clicking the "Completar (Complete)" button changes the style of the task with a strikethrough. Clicking the "Eliminar (Delete)" button removes the task from the list.
